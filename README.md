# Google Images Scraper & Downloader

This is an application for scraping and downloading images from Google.
Made with python, selenium ( Chromium )

## This will only work oh Windows x64 systems, for other systems you have to make some tweaks to the source code. 

It will make a folder called "imgSearch" in your Desktop where it will download the images.

This is not a standalone application; You need more files like Chrome and WebDriver.
But worry not,
## Simply download the rar file from the below given link, extract it and voila, run googleImages.exe and you're good to go.
